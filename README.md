# Bowtie

Decoding the topology of large networks by constructing and visualizing weighted topological overlap (wTO) matrices to allow the mining of the functional information encoded in the topology. This R package applies multiprocessing to increase the wTO matrix calculation speed.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have devtools installed and loaded:
```R
install("devtools")
library("devtools")
```

Then install the bowtie package directly from github
```R
install_github("k-niss/bowtie")
library("bowtie")
```

You may have to install the github repertoire using R in the terminal instead of in Rstudio. After that you can just restart Rstudio and load the library in the standard way using library(bowtie).

### Prerequisites

Remember to install and then load the following packages before using the bowtie functions.

```R
library(igraph)       # Graph package
library(reshape2)     # Matrix manipulation
library(pbapply)      # Apply functions with multiprocessing and progress bar
library(parallel)     # For multiprocessing
library(RColorBrewer) # Nice colors
```

## Tutorials

Below in part A, we present how to calculate a wTO matrix based on an igraph object and followlingly how to visualize it. In part B, we illustrate how to extract protein complexes and knot proteins from a network adjacency matrix of direct interaction scores and how to visualize the results.

### Tutorial part A: Creating and visualizing a wTO matrix

Create a toy network using the igraph function sample_pa() and visualize it:
```R
random_graph           = sample_pa(n=100, power = 1.2, directed=F)
E(random_graph)$weight = runif(n=length(E(random_graph)))
plot(random_graph, 
     vertex.size=2, 
     layout = igraph::layout.gem(random_graph))
```


Calculate pariwise weighted topological overlap (wTO) for all node pairs:
```R
wTO_list = wTO.network(node_vector = as.vector(V(random_graph)), 
                       igraph_object = random_graph, 
                       thread_numb = 2)
```


Convert the list format into a symmetric wTO matrix:
```R
wTO_matrix = from.list.to.df(wTO_list)
```


Order the columns and rows of the matrix, to make patterns stand out:
```R
hclust_object = hclust(as.dist(1-wTO_matrix), method = 'average')
node_order    = hclust_object$labels[hclust_object$order]
```


Visualize the matrix to get an overview of the topology:
```R
image(wTO_matrix[node_order,node_order], useRaster = T, col = colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(9,"YlGnBu"))(49))
```

### Tutorial part B: Locating protein complexes and bow-tie motifs

Since the toy network in part A do not contain modular structures, we load an adjacency matrix of the cDC1 cell, which is included in the bowtie R package.
```R
data()
```
