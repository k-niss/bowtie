Title: Create wTO matrices to decode network topology
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Kristoffer", "Niss", email = "kristoffer.niss@cpr.ku.dk", role = c("cre"))
Description: The topology (layout) of a network is hard to decode using
    standard visualisation approaches, when the size of the network exceeds 
    1000 nodes. Yet, in the age of big data, 1000 nodes in a network is not
    uncommon. This package allows the construction of wTO matrices that
    makes the decoding of network topology of even very large networks
    simpler.
